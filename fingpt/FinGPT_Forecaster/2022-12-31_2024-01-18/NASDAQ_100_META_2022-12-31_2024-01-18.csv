Steve Pavlick, Renaissance Macro Research Head of Policy, notes there are several ways TikTok usage could be tailored by the U.S. government. One solution would be spearheaded by the Commerce Department, which could ban the use of TikTok in the U.S through restricting app downloads and limiting its role in commerce, Pavlick wrote recently. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), would lead the other charge. Regardless of the path to the limitations, Pavlick believes TikTok, which just eclipsed 150 million monthly active users, should be banned in the U.S. Social media stocks have popped on such speculation over the past month. Shares of Meta (META), Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) have all risen over the last several weeks as the notion of banning TikTok has gained bipartisan support. In the video above, Pavlick joins Yahoo Finance's Dave Briggs and Seana Smith to explain why he believes TikTok should be banned.

There\u2019s a chance the days of endlessly swiping through videos on the platform are numbered. So how did we get here? Alex Zhu and Luyu Yang originally launched an app called Musical.ly way back in 2014. It became especially popular in the U.S. among tweens and preteens who would use it to share videos of themselves lip syncing to songs. ByteDance, meanwhile, was already running TikTok, and seeing how popular Musical.ly was, bought the company for $1 billion in 2017. It merged the two apps in 2018, bringing all Musical.ly users over to TikTok and kickstarting what would become one of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms. But TikTok\u2019s connection to China, coupled with the fact that it\u2019s so popular with younger users, sent regulators and politicians in the U.S. and abroad into overdrive. The government\u2019s beef with the app is over whether it\u2019s shipping U.S. users\u2019 data to China which then uses it to spy on Americans and spread pro-Beijing propaganda and disinformation. A number of states and federal agencies, not to mention the military, have banned the use of the app on official devices and networks.

With the Federal Reserve's next policy announcement coming up in May, investors are looking for light at the end of the rate-hike tunnel. Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, tells Yahoo Finance that a Fed pause could be a benefit for the tech industry. Last week's weekly jobless claims bolstered bets that the Fed may pause its interest rate-hike cycle in an effort to tame inflation. \""I think the cuts come in 2024, and then I would expect tech to continue to perform well,\"" Polcari says. If the Fed is forced into another position to raise rates due to rising inflation, Polcari says it would be bad for the industry. \""Tech isn't going to like that, and investors are going to take money out [of tech]...and a bunch of areas of tech...will immediately come under pressure,\"" he says.

Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. \u201cAI can be used\u2026 for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon\u2026. Whenever we have new technologies, they\u2019re used to achieve positive goals and\u2026 for some challenging things as well,\u201d Gates notes. \u201cWhen we computers, books, video games... we had to think\u2026 what\u2019s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those\u2026 negative things.\u201d Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that \u201cAI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you\u2019ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.\u201d Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta\u2019s AI products have benefited advertisers. \u201cBack in \u201922, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products.

But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it\u2019s the future. And that it\u2019s actually mainstream at this point.\u201d \u201cIt really is getting to the point where we\u2019re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,\u201d Knopp adds.

How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,\u201d Narasimhan notes. \u201cIt is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.\u201d Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI \u201cis an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and\u2026 ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been\u2026 engaging in artificial intelligence for\u2026 well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services.

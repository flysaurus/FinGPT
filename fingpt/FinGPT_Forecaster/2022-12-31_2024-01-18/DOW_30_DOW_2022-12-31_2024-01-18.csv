'I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable,' said Laidler.  While Heltman stated that 'this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later.'  Full video transcript:  John Heltman (00:00:05) - The banks that have reported so far, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, did better than expected, but these are some of the bigger banks. The place to watch is the mid-size regionals, the PNCs, the M&Ts. PNC's numbers came in last week and they were, you know, decent. Although their warning of concerns about tighter net interest margins with cost of funds really going up and cost of long-dated loans staying the same. So that's something to watch, especially for smaller and mid-size banks. You saw the last month $300 billion in deposits left banks and something like $240 billion went into money market funds. And that's for the simple reason that they make more money in a money market fund than in a bank, although they don't have the security of deposit insurance that you have with a bank. So this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later, to figure out how to even the playing field between money market funds and banks and bank deposits, to figure out how to stem that tide. But it's not, I don't predict it being a giant rush, but it's gonna be a slow drip over time and a slow drip that is going to impact, especially, as I said, the smaller and medium-sized banks. Ben Laidler (00:01:16) - Financial conditions are tightening. I think the banks are gonna be doing the Fed's work for it. We're not saying there's a banking crisis, but, you know, we have lived through a scare. And I think that means a couple of things. I think deposits are leaving the system. They're being attracted into money market funds by the 5% rates that are on offer versus the sub 1% you get at your bank. That predates SVB and the recent banking scare. So I think that's gonna continue and you've absolutely seen that even with the results from the big banks.\u00a0 Secondly, I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable. And I think thirdly, the smaller banks have seen, you know, the worst of this sort of deposit outflows are gonna see the worst of this regulatory crackdown. But I think regardless everybody is gonna be lending less going forward than they might otherwise have done. And lending standards already tightening. So again, I think this is just, you know, we've already got the lagged effect of 5% interest rates, and now on top of that, we've got banks which are gonna be lending less, and that that combination is gonna slow the economy in slow earnings, which we really haven't seen yet.

Full video transcript: Nina Schick (00:00:06 -> 00:00:55) - The AI that's seizing the market right now, that everyone is trying to get ahead of, that all the tech companies have pivoted to, so-called generative AI. I mean, it really only kicked off in the last six months or so with the release of ChatGPT and some foundational models before that. And the acceleration, both of the technology and its applications are unprecedented. So when it comes to regulating this new space of A.I., regulators are far, far, far behind. Fundamentally, the question is going to be how do you regulate whilst trying to make sure that innovation isn't being stifled? They're all powered by data. So who owns that data? Who owns the output? These are all absolutely integral questions for the future of artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Kenny Polcari (00:00:55 -> 00:01:29) - When it comes to artificial intelligence, there's lots of opportunity.

I would look at other names like C3.ai, which is another artificial intelligence name. But I think you have to go in with your eyes open and, and figure out who you are and where you are on not only the lifecycle scale but on the risk scale.

Patterson said, 'I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results.' While Leon added, 'this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth.' Full video transcript: Justin Patterson (00:00:06 -> 00:01:05) - Netflix is more of a pricing story. When you think about just the phasing of revenue growth this year and over the medium term, it's really a function of extracting more value from that customer base. Whether it's cracking down on the password sharing or moving from walk to run on the ad service where you have much more ads being delivered, better targeting, and ultimately better monetization of that time spent on the platform. How do you get just users to pay a little more, to consume more ads on a platform, so on and so forth? So I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results. I don't think you'll actually start to see more normalized growth until 2024 when we get out of some of these macro factors near term. And a lot of these product initiatives, just move from initial testing phase toward broader deployment and adoption. Ken Leon (00:01:06 -> 00:01:57) - What does Netflix look like as it goes more significantly to paid sharing or friends and family? We're gonna see that in the second quarter. And the the other issue really relates to the ad pay plan. There hasn't been any cannibalization from the higher ad-free plan. And then advertising revenue really is not gonna be material until next year. And it all, for Netflix, it's kind of, it's not self-inflicted as, but this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth. I have total confidence that their $17 billion content spent on programming and film is the most efficient and highest return, and they got a global platform that enables them to have local programming by country and then share it in other parts of the world.

So it's got huge volatility, short sellers like the volatility because they can get a big bang for their buck when the stock goes up or down. So when you see these huge losses, you'll see people getting squeezed in the stock and short sellers will cover. The thing with Tesla that's interesting is that when one person gets out, another person gets in. It's kinda like the WWE, keep getting tagged in. Craig Irwin (00:00:28 -> 00:00:51) - It's a great company, great products, love the fact that they pioneered this market, but there are a lot of other companies that are gonna be successful here too. And the valuation is egregious. EVs are inevitable. There's gonna be a lot of companies that are successful. There are going to be a lot of companies in the supply chain, either on the battery side or the component side that are going to be successful. I just don't think Tesla is the one to invest in here.

We are creating a safer supply chain, a simpler, shorter supply chain, and we can provide much more surety of supply on top of the sustainability. So we're over a hundred times more productive than a square foot of farmland outside. And all the while we use a very small fraction of water compared to traditional agriculture.

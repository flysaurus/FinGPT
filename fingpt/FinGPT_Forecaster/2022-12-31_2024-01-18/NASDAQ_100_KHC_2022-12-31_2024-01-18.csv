At Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, NJ, Clouse tells Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi how he re-centered the historic brand, guided the company through the pandemic, and is now leading Campbell Soup into the future.

Clouse took over as the 14th CEO of Campbell Soup since the company was founded in 1869. One of his biggest moves since taking the reins, includes the acquisition of the popular pasta sauce brand, Rao\u2019s, along with their parent company, Sovos Brands (SOVO).

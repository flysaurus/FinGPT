However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.""}, {""date"": ""20230302200700"", ""headline"": ""Big US Stocks` Q4`22 Fundamentals"", ""summary"": ""Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer breaks down some of Swift\u2019s recognitions in the world of finance news. On July 12, Swift received a mention in the Fed Beige Book as the Philadelphia Fed noted the boost in hotel sales and the economy when her Eras Tour came to town. On July 21, Moody\u2019s analytics published \u201cSwiftflation \u2013 An Unprecedented Boost\u201d and on July 26, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was asked a question about Taylor Swift and the Barbie movie in regards to consumer spending. 7.

Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year. We won\u2019t know retail theft\u2019s impact for 2023 till next year, but Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brooke DiPalma takes a look at the average shrink rate in 2022. According to the National Retail Federation, there was $112.1 billion of losses in fiscal year 2022, which was up 1.6 percent year-over-year. Organized retail theft made up 36 percent of that number, while internal theft made up 29 percent. Process errors made up 27 percent and unknown reasons made up the last seven percent. 5. Weight Loss Drug Craze (00:01:56) Weight loss drugs have grown in popularity this year. Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the GLP-1 drugs. \u201cThere\u2019s type 2 diabetes drugs and weight loss drugs that make up the class of GLP-1 drugs\u2026 The diabetes drugs are Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Mounjaro, which are both available off-label for weight loss,\u201d Khemlani notes. Yahoo Finance named Novo Nordisk as the 2023 Company of the Year, as the company's Ozempic and Wegovy are very popular drugs in the weight loss space. 4. Union Strikes (00:02:15) The entertainment and automotive industry were both impacted by strikes this year as Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and United Auto Workers went on strike. The WGA went on strike in May and the SAG joined the writers on the picket line in July. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal notes that although the WGA and SAG are different, \u201cthe threadline is similar, in terms of what they were fighting for.\u201d Some elements in the actors' deal included, 7% general wage hike, AI protections, and $40 million a year streaming residual bonus. The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3. Collapse of Regional Banks (00:02:33) Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were two of the regional banks that collapsed this year. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the timeline of the collapses. On March 8, SVB planned an emergency stock sale and on March 9, customers attempted to withdraw $42 billion. On March 10, regulators shut down SVB and two days later, on March 12, regulators shutdown Signature Bank. 2. The Fed (00:03:06) Inflation and interest rates continued to impact Americans this year. \u201cThe Central Bank began 2023 slowing the pace of its most aggressive rate hiking campaign to cool inflation since the 1980s,\u201d Yahoo Finance Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains. \u201cAs 2023 comes to an end, that campaigns appears to be all but over.\u201d 1. AI (00:03:24) It has been quite the year for artificial intelligence. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley takes a look at the year AI has had. \u201cTo say that 2023 was the year of AI, would be the understatement of, well, the year,\u201d Howley says. In second quarter 2023, AI was mentioned 62 times at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), 58 times at Microsoft (MSFT), and 827 times in total for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to Reuters. Although 2023 was the year of AI, \u201cit started in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI,\u201d Howley notes. \u201cThe chat bot quickly became the fastest growing app in history, to that point,\u201d hitting 100 million users in two months. In May 2023, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) market value \u201cbriefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time. Cementing its status as the AI chip leader,\u201d Howley explains.

We're already seeing that, and in that type of environment McDonald's tends to take some share,\"" Saleh said. \""One of our top picks for 2024 is Domino's.\"" The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) topped the ranking. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the list. \""Not surprisingly in a year that was all about the mega caps, the Mag Seven, they dominate the top ten most popular pages visited by you on the Yahoo Finance app and website,\"" Blikre said. \""And the winner by far is Tesla ... that was seen over 300 million times this year.\"" 2024 election (00:03:21) The 2024 election cycle is right around the corner and with that comes massive swaths of information about the candidates and the election itself. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley broke down the impact that generative AI can have on the election, specifically as it pertains to disinformation. Howley said, \""The AI revolution has really supercharged a lot of companies ... but there also are some drawbacks, and those include the spread of disinformation and misinformation ... basically allowing them to manipulate the news.\"" LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder discussed the historical impact of the presidential election on the stock market. Buchbinder explained, \""If you look back at history, the economy is really the biggest driver of not just how elections turn out but how markets do. So if we continue to have surprises on the U.S. economy like we've had in 2023, then no doubt this market can do quite a bit better than that historical average.\"" Video highlights: 00:00:05 - Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield 00:00:22 - Goldman Sachs Chief US Economist David Mericle 00:00:47 - Wagner James Au, Author of Making a Metaverse That Matters 00:01:06 - Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Global Chair Richard Lesser 00:01:20 - Ruben Roy, Stifel Applied Technology Analyst 00:01:36 - Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth, U.S. Senior Energy Trader 00:01:58 - iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer 00:02:19 - Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy 00:02:36 - Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst 00:03:00 - Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre 00:03:21 - Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley 00:03:48 - LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder Be sure to watch all of Yahoo Finance's 2024 Investor Guide.""}, {""date"": ""20231222191147"", ""headline"": ""Fabrinet: A Key Enabler Of The AI Revolution"", ""summary"": ""Fabrinet is an important part of the data center ecosystem.

However, mixed economic reports out of China disappointed many on Wall Street. It calls into question what investors need to consider when investing in China-exposed companies. James Early, BBAE Chief Investment Officer, and Dory Wiley, Commerce Street Capital President, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Chinese markets and what investors should keep their eyes on. Early affirms: \""I don't think the Chinese economy is a big driver for semis [semiconductors]. The driver there is probably regulation, but going back to the Chinese economy, I would liken it to the adult child who's trying to move out of his parent's basement, but is just having trouble doing that... By that I mean, they've kind of been trying to get on its own feet in a consumer spending sense, it's about 53% of the economy right now, where as the US is about 68%, but they're just struggling.\""Wiley responds: \""I don't like the exposure to China, I don't like it right now. China is almost uninvestable. That's hard to hear from an investing point of view because we try to keep politics out of it, but there's so many fundamental reasons to try to avoid China as much as we can... China is--exports are down, population is down, the markets down 30%... real estate debt issues, government debt issues, no new construction, and their politics has gone from a party dictatorship to a person dictatorship. So they're moving the wrong direction.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

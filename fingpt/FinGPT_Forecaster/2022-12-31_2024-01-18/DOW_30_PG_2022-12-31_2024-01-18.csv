But is now the time to scoop in and buy some of those beaten down names? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to get their top stock picks. UBS U.S. Household and Personal Care Analyst Peter Grom provided his thoughts on the consumer staples sector overall.

PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston explained the company's approach with regard to the consumer. He said, \u201cWe plan the consumer conservatively, that's typically been our practice, and more often than not, the consumer surprises us on the upside. So, we put ourselves in a good position to meet or beat our guidance.\u201d Procter & Gamble (PG) reported first quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. Regarding consumer spending, P&G CEO Jon Moeller said, \u201cThey're continuing to buy our products.

Many companies are making progress, and many are behind.\"" Headquartered in San Jose, California, Zscaler operates in 185 countries around the world, with a workforce of more than 2500 employees. It trades under the ticker symbol (ZS), with shares up 270% since its first day of trading in 2018.\u00a0 Zscaler\u2019s flagship product is the \u2018Zero Trust Exchange,' a cloud platform that\u2019s distributed across more than 150 data centers around the world. \""The way Zscaler was designed, it was assumed that the user could be working from anywhere and applications could be in data center, in factory.

Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. \u201cAI can be used\u2026 for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon\u2026. Whenever we have new technologies, they\u2019re used to achieve positive goals and\u2026 for some challenging things as well,\u201d Gates notes. \u201cWhen we computers, books, video games... we had to think\u2026 what\u2019s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those\u2026 negative things.\u201d Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that \u201cAI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you\u2019ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.\u201d Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta\u2019s AI products have benefited advertisers. \u201cBack in \u201922, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they\u2019re doing that is because it\u2019s giving them better targeting and better performance,\u201d Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that \u201cgenerative AI will be important for our... business.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it\u2019s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.\u201d Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains \u201cwhat\u2019s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then\u2026 how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.\u201d Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the \u201cexciting opportunities\u201d that come with AI. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we\u2019re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been\u2026 traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,\u201d Benioff says. \u201cRight now AI can really\u2026 make people a lot better.\u201d Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly early\u2026 with AI right now,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cAs this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp explains that \u201c76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they\u2019re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it\u2019s the future. And that it\u2019s actually mainstream at this point.\u201d \u201cIt really is getting to the point where we\u2019re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,\u201d Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company\u2019s drug development. \u201cImpacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,\u201d Narasimhan notes. \u201cIt is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.\u201d Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI \u201cis an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and\u2026 ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been\u2026 engaging in artificial intelligence for\u2026 well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services.

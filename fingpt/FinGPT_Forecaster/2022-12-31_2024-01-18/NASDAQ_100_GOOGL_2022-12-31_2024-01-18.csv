However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.""}, {""date"": ""2023-03-02"", ""headline"": ""Biden Admin's Upcoming Cybersecurity Strategy Can Potentially Put Businesses, Software Providers On Collision Course"", ""summary"": ""The Biden administration is poised to release a new national cybersecurity strategy that aims to make software companies liable for security hacks rather than the companies facing the hack.

It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it. According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it. When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word \""porosity,\"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money. Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses. Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control. By analyzing the sentiment and psychology, traders can determine whether the buyers or sellers have regained control and make informed trading decisions.""}, {""date"": ""2023-03-02"", ""headline"": ""More than 122,000 tech-sector employees have lost their jobs since the start of 2023"", ""summary"": ""More than 122,000 global technology-sector employees have been laid off since the start of 2023, according to data compiled by the website Layoffs.fyi.

The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3.

Wedbush Securities Managing Director Moshe Katri and Macquarie Capital Senior Equity Research Analyst Paul Golding join Yahoo Finance Live to talk all things fintech in the new year. \u201cWhat PayPal has gone through in the past year and a half is really a symptom of pretty much every single fintech company in this universe,\u201d Katri said. \u201cYou cannot exclusively rely on transaction fees in terms of revenue generation. You have to do more than that.\u201d The challenge for new PayPal CEO Alex Chriss is to build a robust line of services for both merchants and consumers on the platform, Katri maintains.

Earnings reports from companies including Walgreens and Constellation Brands, and key economic data such as the JOLTS and December jobs report, are all set to come out this week. Yahoo Finance breaks down what to watch in the first week of the year. On the earnings side, several companies will be reporting results. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) will be reporting on Wednesday, January 3, while Conagra Brands (CAG) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will report before the open on Thursday, January 4. Constellation Brands (STZ) will close out the week, reporting results on Friday, January 5. On the economic data front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report for November will be released on Wednesday, January 3, with \u201cjobs openings expected to rise roughly 8.8 million from the 8.7 million in October,\u201d as Yahoo Finance\u2019s Madison Mills discusses.

CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford (00:01:21) CleanSpark (CLSK) CEO Zach Bradford discusses Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and bitcoin ETF approval. \u201cThe strength of Bitcoin is partially based on how many users use it, what adoption looks like, and what the access looks like,\u201d Bradford says. \u201cThe Bitcoin approving ETF helps everybody view also the related industries around it as something that is a little more friendly, a little more accessible for your everyday investor.\u201d Riot Platforms CEO Jason Les (00:02:05) Riot Platforms (RIOT) CEO Jason Les explains why spot bitcoin ETF approval is a \u201crising tide that will lift all boats in the industry.\u201d \u201cHistorically, a lot of investors who may have had an interest in Bitcoin have been unable to get exposure to the asset. Now with ETFs\u2026 those investors can get indirect exposure to Bitcoin and use that as a part of their portfolio management,\u201d Les notes. \u201cWe believe this is going to bring a huge inflow of new capital into the space that should have a very positive catalyst on the price of Bitcoin.\u201d Tilray CEO Irwin Simon (00:02:48) Tilray (TLRY) CEO Irwin Simon notes how the company is creating something \u201cdifferent\u201d and \u201cnew.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not many companies out there today that have medical cannabis, recreational cannabis, spirits and beer, medical distribution\u2026 so we\u2019re creating something that\u2019s different, we\u2019re creating something that\u2019s new,\u201d Simon explains."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=577132bbcc6c33a31d6601f4a8142caeb625f2190050d0dd57b25a94e7167c5f""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1704993120, ""headline"": ""Walgreens CEO Bought Up Stock After Cutting Dividend"", ""id"": 124988919, ""image"": ""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IiqqLdx0koygts2sicF.pw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Barrons.com/6ded5b9f0871911ae3aa439aebffb768"", ""related"": ""WBA"", ""source"": ""Yahoo"", ""summary"": ""Tim Wentworth bought shares of the pharmacy chain the day after the Walgreens CEO announced the quarterly dividend would be cut nearly in half."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=74e7385db3c3a2b6f40b6abf9a9da92b010f2dc45abbf98d0955660b44315ad2""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1704992880, ""headline"": ""Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. stock falls Thursday, underperforms market"", ""id"": 125057719, ""image"": ""https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social"", ""related"": ""WBA"", ""source"": ""MarketWatch"", ""summary"": ""Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. shed 2.63% to $24.03 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around mixed trading session for the stock market, with..."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8b75d34c86211ac14be8a39fc15821deccbdb36250546526ce16240a94a8d37e""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1704971760, ""headline"": ""Goldman Sachs, Walgreens Boots share losses lead Dow's 266-point drop"", ""id"": 125010739, ""image"": ""https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"", ""related"": ""WBA"", ""source"": ""MarketWatch"", ""summary"": ""Behind declines for shares of Goldman Sachs and Walgreens Boots, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading down Thursday morning.

How Artificial Intelligence is Shaping the Future of Work"", ""summary"": ""Generative AI, augmented intelligence, machine learning- these topics have dominated the conversation around tech in 2023, and by now we\u2019ve all heard the rumors: AI is coming for your job, it will take your family, and it will eat the food off your dinner plate, but is there any truth behind this? To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest. Webster\u2019s dictionary defines AI as \u201cthe simulation of human behavior in computers\u201d. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain. Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology. \u201cGenerative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,\u201d says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do. \u201cWe are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work\u2026 what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution\u2026 we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.\u201d So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology? We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980\u2019s supercomputer, \u201cDeep Blue\u201d. \u201cEvery new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,\u201d Kasparov told us. \u201cAI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past\u2026 so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.\u201d So far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close. According to ChatGPT, \u201cArtificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound too bad, but it goes on: \u201cOne major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.\u201d Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution. \u201cPeople are getting freaked out. They\u2019re saying \u2018Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?\u2019\u201d \u201cI see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,\u201d says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool. Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve\u00a0our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks. \u201cIf an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,\u201d Pulkit says. While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.

Ultimately humans will be the winners and we'll see humans continue to get more creative and more productive\u2026AI can be used in music to enhance production, consumption, many different things. and I think the possibilities are endless,\u201d Fine says. So endless, that in just a few months AI generated artworks have spread across the internet like wildfire and developers made a boatload of money for what seemed like an original idea. \u201cEspecially in the art space, we have lawsuits that have been taking place around representation and compensation. Artists are often having their art put into the data set to train those models without any notification and without any compensation, notice, or attribution,\u201d Signal and Cipher CEO, Ian Beacraft told us. \u201cPeople have put out their life's work onto the internet, and now these models have come along and scrapes the whole internet and said \u2018we're just training it on everything.\u201d\u2019 Theft of intellectual property is hardly a modern problem, but leave it to the free market to come up with a modern solution. Image licensing companies like Getty (GETY) and Shutterstock (SSTK) are diving head-first onto the AI wave, using their massive image databases to build AI content generators and sharing the profits with contributing artists. \u201cThe way that people tell stories is continuing to evolve. At one point it was images, then it was video,and now it's music. Now it may be generated content,\u201d says Shutterstock Chief Product Officer Meghan Schoen. So what does the future of creativity look like? Schoen says, \u201cthe way I describe it is you're sitting in a pitch meeting or trying to bring an idea to life and you may have a vision in your head of astronauts eating breakfast on Mars. In the past, how do you actually describe that to a roomful of creatives? To help them understand and conceptualize what you're talking about? Now, they can just describe that, get a visual, and now they're not starting from a blank piece of paper\u2026 and they can build stories on top of that.\u201d""}, {""date"": ""2023-04-07"", ""headline"": ""The bombshell report that Tesla employees had access to cars\u2019 video recordings is a reminder of a risk we all face"", ""summary"": ""A new report from Reuters reveals that Tesla employees have been privately sharing the videos that customers\u2019 cars record.""}, {""date"": ""2023-04-07"", ""headline"": ""Why Tesla Stock Fell 10% This Week"", ""summary"": ""Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell by as much as 13.4% this week, according to data from\u00a0S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Houchois downgraded its shares to Hold from Buy, and dropped the price target to $185 from $230. Tesla shares slid sharply after first quarter results revealed those tighter margins; the selloff pushing Elon Musk's business below the half-trillion dollar mark.

The comments allude to Tesla's pricing strategy; Elon Musk told investors last month that \""pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice\"" after lower prices narrowed margins for the automaker. Despite the comments, Ford unveiled cuts of it own. It's dropping the cost of its Mustang Mach-E by up to $4,000. It also laid out its first quarter earnings by division for the first time. Although the automaker beat overall expectations with strong revenue growth, its EV division revealed a pre-tax loss of $722 million. Ford expects it to turn operating margins positive by 2026. Ford is taking a \""balanced approach\"" to EV pricing, Lawler says, making sure any adjustments serve the company well in the long run. When cutting costs, Ford will be \""thoughtful\"" to keep that balance. Lawler added that Ford is at an advantage as one of the first movers in the EV space, which will help establish brand loyalty among new EV customers.

Looking at 2024, the market looks very well balanced ... the key that people are looking at is can the U.S. continue to outperform.\"" Tesla (TSLA) has had quite a turbulent year in 2023. iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer discussed the outlook for Tesla in 2024 amid the competition from major companies like Ford (F) and GM (GM). Brauer said, \""Tesla shares ... they're down to about half the market. And of course they were the overwhelmingly dominant player just a few years ago. Every day, every month, every year we see more cars entering this marketplace, making them less dominant.\"" Looking ahead to 2024, Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy, discussed how geopolitical tensions and other factors may impact oil and gas prices. De Haan explained, \""The national average is basically on par with where we were last year, but we could see a little bit more increase over the next few days into the holiday and into the close of the New Year.\"" State of the consumer (00:02:36) Investors often look for recession proof investments during uncertain times, including food and beverage staples. Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, top picks for 2024 include McDonald's (MCD) and Domino's (DPZ). \""2024 we're going to start the year with a lot of discounts. We're already seeing that, and in that type of environment McDonald's tends to take some share,\"" Saleh said. \""One of our top picks for 2024 is Domino's.\"" The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) topped the ranking. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the list. \""Not surprisingly in a year that was all about the mega caps, the Mag Seven, they dominate the top ten most popular pages visited by you on the Yahoo Finance app and website,\"" Blikre said. \""And the winner by far is Tesla ... that was seen over 300 million times this year.\"" 2024 election (00:03:21) The 2024 election cycle is right around the corner and with that comes massive swaths of information about the candidates and the election itself. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley broke down the impact that generative AI can have on the election, specifically as it pertains to disinformation. Howley said, \""The AI revolution has really supercharged a lot of companies ... but there also are some drawbacks, and those include the spread of disinformation and misinformation ... basically allowing them to manipulate the news.\"" LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder discussed the historical impact of the presidential election on the stock market. Buchbinder explained, \""If you look back at history, the economy is really the biggest driver of not just how elections turn out but how markets do. So if we continue to have surprises on the U.S. economy like we've had in 2023, then no doubt this market can do quite a bit better than that historical average.\"" Video highlights: 00:00:05 - Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield 00:00:22 - Goldman Sachs Chief US Economist David Mericle 00:00:47 - Wagner James Au, Author of Making a Metaverse That Matters 00:01:06 - Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Global Chair Richard Lesser 00:01:20 - Ruben Roy, Stifel Applied Technology Analyst 00:01:36 - Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth, U.S. Senior Energy Trader 00:01:58 - iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer 00:02:19 - Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy 00:02:36 - Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst 00:03:00 - Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre 00:03:21 - Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley 00:03:48 - LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder Be sure to watch all of Yahoo Finance's 2024 Investor Guide.""}, {""date"": ""2023-12-22"", ""headline"": ""Dow Jones Futures: Market Won't Back Down; Two Magnificent Seven Stocks Forge New Buy Points"", ""summary"": ""The market rally won't back down, but a break would be nice.

However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.""}, {""date"": ""2023-03-02"", ""headline"": ""Biden Admin's Upcoming Cybersecurity Strategy Can Potentially Put Businesses, Software Providers On Collision Course"", ""summary"": ""The Biden administration is poised to release a new national cybersecurity strategy that aims to make software companies liable for security hacks rather than the companies facing the hack.

It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it. According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it. When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word \""porosity,\"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money. Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses. Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control. By analyzing the sentiment and psychology, traders can determine whether the buyers or sellers have regained control and make informed trading decisions.""}, {""date"": ""2023-03-02"", ""headline"": ""More than 122,000 tech-sector employees have lost their jobs since the start of 2023"", ""summary"": ""More than 122,000 global technology-sector employees have been laid off since the start of 2023, according to data compiled by the website Layoffs.fyi.

Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, tells Yahoo Finance that a Fed pause could be a benefit for the tech industry. Last week's weekly jobless claims bolstered bets that the Fed may pause its interest rate-hike cycle in an effort to tame inflation. \""I think the cuts come in 2024, and then I would expect tech to continue to perform well,\"" Polcari says. If the Fed is forced into another position to raise rates due to rising inflation, Polcari says it would be bad for the industry. \""Tech isn't going to like that, and investors are going to take money out [of tech]...and a bunch of areas of tech...will immediately come under pressure,\"" he says.

But there are growing concerns about whether those stocks have come too far, too fast.\u00a0 Paul Meeks, Independent Solutions Wealth Management Portfolio Manager, tells Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita that he is worried about the valuations of tech stocks. Meeks cites two reasons. First is the AI hype. Meeks notes that a lot of companies spoke about AI on their earnings calls, but analysts didn't adjust their outlooks based on those comments, with the exception of Nvidia (NVDA). The second is interest rates. \""Tech and aggressive growth stocks need low interest rates,\"" Meeks said, so the Federal Reserve's \""hawkish pause\"" is a \""real incremental negative\"" to tech stocks.\u00a0 When it comes to specific stocks, Meeks says the two recent Alphabet (GOOGL) downgrades are \""legit,\"" even though he likes the stock long term. Meeks says he is looking for defensive stocks within the tech sector. When it comes to defensive AI plays, Meeks specifically mentions Extreme Networks (EXTR) and AMD (AMD). Meeks also likes Uber Technologies (UBER) which he says is on a \""very visible path to profitability,\"" while rival Lyft (LYFT) is \""a company that's badly damaged.\"" As far as Tesla (TSLA) is concerned, Meeks says the stock's performance is \""a bit worrisome,\"" adding that it can sometimes be hard to value because \""it's more a cult.\""\u00a0 Meeks is less of a fan of Chinese tech stocks such as JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) because of the China's weak economic recovery from the Covid pandemic.\u00a0 Key video moments 00:00:55 Meeks on Alphabet downgrades 00:01:30 Meeks explains why he is concerned about tech valuations 00:03:14 How Meeks is playing AI 00:03:40 Best ways to play AI 00:04:45 What Meeks likes about Uber Technologies 00:05:19 Why Meeks is not a fan of some Chinese stocks 00:06:08 Meeks on Tesla""}, {""date"": ""2023-06-27"", ""headline"": ""Databricks says it\u2019s buying MosaicML in a bid to \u2018democratize A.I.\u2019"", ""summary"": ""MosaicML\u2019s venture investors aren\u2019t cashing out with the sale, but early backers are on track to make \u201csignificant double-digit cash-on-cash returns\u201d when Databricks does exit.""}, {""date"": ""2023-06-27"", ""headline"": ""Databricks Purchases AI Startup MosaicML For $1.3 Billion"", ""summary"": ""Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate the news headlines, with leading tech companies like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. investing big money in the technology.

I think that's going to be the big theme when you look ahead to 2024.\"" Oil, energy, and gas (00:01:36) 2023 was a volatile year for oil prices (BZ=F, CL=F). Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth, U.S. Senior Energy Trader discussed some of the major catalysts for oil in 2024. Babin said, \""So I think the key for 2024 is going to be what does U.S. supply do? Looking at 2024, the market looks very well balanced ... the key that people are looking at is can the U.S. continue to outperform.\"" Tesla (TSLA) has had quite a turbulent year in 2023. iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer discussed the outlook for Tesla in 2024 amid the competition from major companies like Ford (F) and GM (GM). Brauer said, \""Tesla shares ... they're down to about half the market. And of course they were the overwhelmingly dominant player just a few years ago. Every day, every month, every year we see more cars entering this marketplace, making them less dominant.\"" Looking ahead to 2024, Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy, discussed how geopolitical tensions and other factors may impact oil and gas prices. De Haan explained, \""The national average is basically on par with where we were last year, but we could see a little bit more increase over the next few days into the holiday and into the close of the New Year.\"" State of the consumer (00:02:36) Investors often look for recession proof investments during uncertain times, including food and beverage staples. Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, top picks for 2024 include McDonald's (MCD) and Domino's (DPZ). \""2024 we're going to start the year with a lot of discounts. We're already seeing that, and in that type of environment McDonald's tends to take some share,\"" Saleh said. \""One of our top picks for 2024 is Domino's.\"" The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) topped the ranking. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the list. \""Not surprisingly in a year that was all about the mega caps, the Mag Seven, they dominate the top ten most popular pages visited by you on the Yahoo Finance app and website,\"" Blikre said. \""And the winner by far is Tesla ... that was seen over 300 million times this year.\"" 2024 election (00:03:21) The 2024 election cycle is right around the corner and with that comes massive swaths of information about the candidates and the election itself. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley broke down the impact that generative AI can have on the election, specifically as it pertains to disinformation. Howley said, \""The AI revolution has really supercharged a lot of companies ... but there also are some drawbacks, and those include the spread of disinformation and misinformation ... basically allowing them to manipulate the news.\"" LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder discussed the historical impact of the presidential election on the stock market. Buchbinder explained, \""If you look back at history, the economy is really the biggest driver of not just how elections turn out but how markets do. So if we continue to have surprises on the U.S. economy like we've had in 2023, then no doubt this market can do quite a bit better than that historical average.\"" Video highlights: 00:00:05 - Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield 00:00:22 - Goldman Sachs Chief US Economist David Mericle 00:00:47 - Wagner James Au, Author of Making a Metaverse That Matters 00:01:06 - Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Global Chair Richard Lesser 00:01:20 - Ruben Roy, Stifel Applied Technology Analyst 00:01:36 - Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth, U.S. Senior Energy Trader 00:01:58 - iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer 00:02:19 - Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy 00:02:36 - Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst 00:03:00 - Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre 00:03:21 - Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley 00:03:48 - LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder Be sure to watch all of Yahoo Finance's 2024 Investor Guide.""}, {""date"": ""2023-12-22"", ""headline"": ""Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Alphabet vs. Apple"", ""summary"": ""One of these companies has a more established role in AI and is trading at a better value.""}, {""date"": ""2023-12-22"", ""headline"": ""Google Rejected\u00a0Play Store\u00a0Fee Changes Due to Impact on Revenue,\u00a0Epic Lawsuit Shows"", ""summary"": ""(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google considered changing its app store pricing model to circumvent a regulatory crackdown, but abandoned a proposal to charge a set fee per app after it became clear that could cost the company billions of dollars, according to documents released late Thursday.Most Read from BloombergHyperloop One to Shut Down After Failing to Reinvent TransitTencent Leads $80 Billion Rout as China Rekindles Crackdown FearSupreme Court Refuses to Fast-Track Trump Immunity ClashSt""}, {""date"": ""2023-12-22"", ""headline"": ""Instagram launched a major campaign to champion parent control over app downloads"", ""summary"": ""And offload responsibility for this onto the app stores.""}, {""date"": ""2023-12-22"", ""headline"": ""Amazon Ramps Up AI Game at AWS re:Invent to Tackle Microsoft and Google's Rise"", ""summary"": ""Every November, Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts re: Invent, a significant trade show in Las Vegas, attracting thousands of software developers and tech executives.

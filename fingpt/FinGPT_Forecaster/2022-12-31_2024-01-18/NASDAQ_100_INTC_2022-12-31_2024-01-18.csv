However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.""}, {""date"": ""20230303020000"", ""headline"": ""Broadcom: Strong Growth Continues"", ""summary"": ""Broadcom is growing fast, trades inexpensively, and offers a nice dividend yield of more than 3%.

Yahoo Finance spoke to experts, analysts, and strategists\u00a0across the industry to determine\u00a0the potential impact on chipmakers like Nvidia, as well as the market implications. Callie Cox, eToro USA Investment Analyst, discussed the impact that the report is having on chipmaking stocks. Cox said, \""I think AI is a great story. I think it's hard to argue against the fact that it could change the world, but these bumps happen when we're talking about new technologies.\"" Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Managing Director and Equity Strategist, broke down the recent rally from AI stocks and chipmakers like\u00a0Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Maley said, \""It'll be interesting, not only this week, but moving to next week a lot of these institutions, they might start to pull back a little bit because of this concern.\"" Phil Orlando, Federated Hermes Chief Equity Strategist, discussed how geopolitical pressures could affect the rapid growth of AI-tied stocks.

While everyday people are going to be using AI, businesses are going to see a greater impact than the average consumer, O\u2019Donnell maintains.

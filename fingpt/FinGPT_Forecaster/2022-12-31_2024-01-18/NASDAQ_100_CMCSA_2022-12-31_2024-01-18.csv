These projects can revolve around sustainability areas like clean transportation and renewable energy. The idea being companies can shift to more sustainable practices while funding the transition at a lower cost. There are rules for these bonds. They must be used for green projects only. Issuers of the bonds must lay out the criteria used to evaluate proposals. Proceeds from the bonds need to be tracked and information must be shared about those proceeds as well as the impact of those projects. Who can issue these bonds? Governments, non-profits, banks and corporations. Rivian isn't the only company to issue green bonds this year. Comcast (CMCSA) announced a $1 billion green bond sale. And VF Corporation (VFC) issued its second green bond for more than $500 million. See the full interview with Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith here.

Disney pulled its channels from Spectrum amid a carriage dispute between the two companies. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Brett Feldman says there are two reasons why this dispute is happening.\u00a0 First with the decline in cable subscribers is accelerating, falling about 6% to 7% this year. Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. \""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,\"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has \""emboldened\"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.\u00a0 The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the \""point of economic indifference,\"" Feldman says. What that means is that given how much cord-cutting is happening, Charter is losing so much profitability in that business and \""basically what they're saying is we almost don't care anymore whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not,\"" Feldman says, adding that they are primarily making their money by providing internet service.\u00a0 Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.""}, {""date"": ""2023-09-05"", ""headline"": ""Comcast Corp.

Target also experienced boycotts in June over pride-themed displays at stores, which impacted the company\u2019s sales.

While consumers seem to be ready to increase spending during this holiday season, wallets will certainly be hurt as inflation remains steady for necessities like food. Stacey Widlitz, SW Retail Advisors Chief International Store Hunter, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into where consumers will be looking for the best deals and which retailers poised to capitalize on current economic trends during this holiday season. On where consumers are focused Widlitz explains: \""Obviously consumers are spending on necessities, you know, we're talking about disinflation and that's great, but the bottom line is food costs are up 20% on a two-year basis and that's not declining, that's just stagnating. So the consumer is still feeling it and still spending on their basics. I think you're going to see a lot of that this holiday season. You're already seeing with the likes of Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) they're pushing hard on food and basics and health.\"" Watch the video above to find out which retailers Widlitz are in the best position for what consumers want right now.\u00a0 For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a7cea2124fea9dc0c6cedf320dd53c0cc14f3c8960203bc8ea980c9d7317e8b7""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1700502412, ""headline"": ""Consumers are cautious, but still splurging on one thing"", ""id"": 124002596, ""image"": ""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hKXWtAf5x_eaJIRxqggLfA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-11/b8cf3710-87cc-11ee-bdbf-c21089c496a9"", ""related"": ""WMT"", ""source"": ""Yahoo"", ""summary"": ""Major retailers including Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have warned of a more discerning consumer, one who is pulling back on discretionary purchases heading into the holidays.

The sites cater to deal-seeking shoppers through a constant inflow of extremely cheap products. Shein's recent Forever 21 partnership aims to expand reach, but McLymore notes major challengers like Amazon built global domination over the years. While surging in popularity for price-sensitive spenders, she believes Chinese fast-fashion players \""still have a long way to go\"" in matching such scale.

On July 21, Moody\u2019s analytics published \u201cSwiftflation \u2013 An Unprecedented Boost\u201d and on July 26, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was asked a question about Taylor Swift and the Barbie movie in regards to consumer spending. 7. Sam Bankman-Fried Goes on Trial (00:01:14) Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan discusses Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraud trial. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of 7 criminal counts and is facing 110 years in prison. In January 2023, Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty. In August, Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail was revoked and he was transferred from house arrest to prison. In October, the criminal trial began and in November, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all counts. 6. Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year. We won\u2019t know retail theft\u2019s impact for 2023 till next year, but Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brooke DiPalma takes a look at the average shrink rate in 2022. According to the National Retail Federation, there was $112.1 billion of losses in fiscal year 2022, which was up 1.6 percent year-over-year. Organized retail theft made up 36 percent of that number, while internal theft made up 29 percent. Process errors made up 27 percent and unknown reasons made up the last seven percent. 5. Weight Loss Drug Craze (00:01:56) Weight loss drugs have grown in popularity this year. Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the GLP-1 drugs. \u201cThere\u2019s type 2 diabetes drugs and weight loss drugs that make up the class of GLP-1 drugs\u2026 The diabetes drugs are Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Mounjaro, which are both available off-label for weight loss,\u201d Khemlani notes. Yahoo Finance named Novo Nordisk as the 2023 Company of the Year, as the company's Ozempic and Wegovy are very popular drugs in the weight loss space. 4. Union Strikes (00:02:15) The entertainment and automotive industry were both impacted by strikes this year as Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and United Auto Workers went on strike. The WGA went on strike in May and the SAG joined the writers on the picket line in July. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal notes that although the WGA and SAG are different, \u201cthe threadline is similar, in terms of what they were fighting for.\u201d Some elements in the actors' deal included, 7% general wage hike, AI protections, and $40 million a year streaming residual bonus. The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3. Collapse of Regional Banks (00:02:33) Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were two of the regional banks that collapsed this year. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the timeline of the collapses. On March 8, SVB planned an emergency stock sale and on March 9, customers attempted to withdraw $42 billion. On March 10, regulators shut down SVB and two days later, on March 12, regulators shutdown Signature Bank. 2. The Fed (00:03:06) Inflation and interest rates continued to impact Americans this year. \u201cThe Central Bank began 2023 slowing the pace of its most aggressive rate hiking campaign to cool inflation since the 1980s,\u201d Yahoo Finance Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains. \u201cAs 2023 comes to an end, that campaigns appears to be all but over.\u201d 1. AI (00:03:24) It has been quite the year for artificial intelligence. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley takes a look at the year AI has had. \u201cTo say that 2023 was the year of AI, would be the understatement of, well, the year,\u201d Howley says. In second quarter 2023, AI was mentioned 62 times at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), 58 times at Microsoft (MSFT), and 827 times in total for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to Reuters. Although 2023 was the year of AI, \u201cit started in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI,\u201d Howley notes. \u201cThe chat bot quickly became the fastest growing app in history, to that point,\u201d hitting 100 million users in two months. In May 2023, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) market value \u201cbriefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time. Cementing its status as the AI chip leader,\u201d Howley explains.

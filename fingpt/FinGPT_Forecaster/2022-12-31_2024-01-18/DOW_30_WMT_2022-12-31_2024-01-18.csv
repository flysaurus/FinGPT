Stacey Widlitz, SW Retail Advisors Chief International Store Hunter, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into where consumers will be looking for the best deals and which retailers poised to capitalize on current economic trends during this holiday season. On where consumers are focused Widlitz explains: \""Obviously consumers are spending on necessities, you know, we're talking about disinflation and that's great, but the bottom line is food costs are up 20% on a two-year basis and that's not declining, that's just stagnating. So the consumer is still feeling it and still spending on their basics. I think you're going to see a lot of that this holiday season.

Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year.

The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3.

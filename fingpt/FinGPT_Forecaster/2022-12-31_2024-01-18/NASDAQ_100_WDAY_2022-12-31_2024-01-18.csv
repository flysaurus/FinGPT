Bracelin explains why there's a great investment opportunity with these stocks: \""There were over 40 cloud software companies growing over 30% back in 2021. If you fast forward to next year there's only four. So growth is scarce again. We think we're entering a whole new investment cycle for these cloud application companies. This time it's really driven by the need to move these applications, these old applications where your data is locked up in on-prem software, you have to modernize to unlock the data and open up some new AI opportunities.

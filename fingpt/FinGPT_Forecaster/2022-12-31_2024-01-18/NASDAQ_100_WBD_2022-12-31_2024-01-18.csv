The company once vowed to be a disruptor to the media industry, but could not figure out a way to turn a profit. Washington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi says digital media organizations made the following claims early on, \""We are the future of media. We can attract millennials, younger audiences, newspapers are dying, print is dying, and this is really the future and they sold this promise, and as we can see, they couldn't grow fast enough to make up for those promises, especially when we're now in an economic environment where the advertising industry and the and the advertising revenue has dropped off.\"" Its potential downfall underscores the tough environment facing digital media companies as they struggle to cut spending during economic uncertainty. \""When we're talking digital media... during the pandemic and especially at the start, we actually saw audience spike, there was a lot of online interest, reader interest saw a lot of that happening, but that didn't necessarily mean an increase in revenues,\"" Elahe Izadi said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Izadi also says that in the case of companies relying on other companies like those who rely on Google (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), their businesses can also be susceptible to disruptions from something like a changed algorithm.

He said, \""Economists are now saying, how much damage is this actually going to cause to the broader U.S. economy? And the answer is hardly any.\"" Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations Senior Economic Advisor Erica Groshen discussed the\u00a0UAW strike and what it could mean for labor conditions. Groshen said, \""We certainly have a very strong labor market, a very strong economy, and strike activity usually rises when the economy and the labor market is strong.\"" Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey revealed his concerns over EV production amid the rise in strikes across the country. Bomey stated, \""I think their long-term concern for the automakers is that they come out of this with higher labor costs which makes it more difficult to make EVs at a price point which people can afford.\"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley broke down what he referred to as \""the summer of strikes.\""\u00a0Bradley said, \""You have these unrealistic, almost excessive demands on the part of union leadership across a whole host of industry that could ultimately be destabilizing for the entire economy.\"" Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden discussed the effect of the\u00a0Hollywood strikes on major studios like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN). Klowden said, \""When we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impact that people are feeling in Hollywood itself but in a number of different places where filming actually takes place. The Hollywood Reporter Media & Business Writer Alex Weprin detailed the content crisis\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u00a0and other\u00a0major\u00a0studios are facing\u00a0amid the writers and actors' strikes. Weprin said, \""In the short term, they're going to have all this extra cash ... but in the long term they do need new scripted TV shows and movies in order to conduct their daily business. MNTN CEO Mark Douglas broke down the major issues between\u00a0writers and Hollywood studios, including\u00a0streaming and AI. Douglas explained, \""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained.\"" David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, \""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income.\"" Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, \""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living.\"" Wheaton added, \""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the\u00a0NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).\"" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman 00:00:27 - Erica Groshen, Cornell University 00:00:40 - Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey 00:00:58 - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley 00:01:15 - Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden 00:01:31 - The Hollywood Reporter Media & Business Writer Alex Weprin 00:01:49 -\u00a0MNTN CEO Mark Douglas 00:02:03 -\u00a0 American Worker Project Senior Adviser David Madland 00:02:21 - Art Wheaton, Cornell University ILR School""}, {""date"": ""2023-09-21"", ""headline"": ""An end in sight?

It was widely expected that Paramount may do some sort of deal, with Wells Fargo upgrading the company's shares on Wednesday on that prospect.\u00a0 William Cohan, Puck News Founding Partner, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what a potential deal would look like between both companies and what the aftermath might look like. Cohan says if the two companies were to merge, they would create a \""behemoth with an awful lot of debt. There's no question about it\"" In terms of how easy or difficult it might be for a deal Cohan says: \""It wouldn't be hard for, say, Apple (AAPL) to buy Paramount. It would be a chip shot.

Discovery, with its $43 billion in debt, and Paramount's $15 billion in debt, and the overlap in terms of business lines, it's going to be difficult, strategically and regulatorily, to get this through.

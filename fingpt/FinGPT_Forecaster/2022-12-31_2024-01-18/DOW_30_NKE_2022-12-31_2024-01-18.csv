West and Adidas parted ways in October 2022 after multiple public antisemitic comments by the rapper. This ended Adidas' run with West\u2019s popular Yeezy line, leaving the athletic apparel company with significant excess inventory and a moral dilemma over whether or not to offload Yeezy merchandise. If Adidas opts not to sell the merchandise, the company says it could report a loss of $750 million in 2023. The absence of Yeezy leaves a hole in the market for celebrity tie-ups on trendy merchandise, which Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih argues Nike could take over. Nike\u2019s had similar success already, particularly with its Jordan Brand, which accounted for more than $5 billion in revenue during 2022.

Dadhania explains: \""Going into next year, China will arguably be still one of the fastest growing regions... in terms of growth contribution, China is still very important. What Nike has done better than peers is two things. Number one, it's been able to deliver stronger revenue growth than its peers through the Covid period because it has a much better DTC business driven by its apps and digital platform. But number two, and perhaps as importantly, it's managed to maintain a profitability profile in China which has not collapsed like it has for some of the others.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

This ended Adidas' run with West\u2019s popular Yeezy line, leaving the athletic apparel company with significant excess inventory and a moral dilemma over whether or not to offload Yeezy merchandise. If Adidas opts not to sell the merchandise, the company says it could report a loss of $750 million in 2023. The absence of Yeezy leaves a hole in the market for celebrity tie-ups on trendy merchandise, which Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih argues Nike could take over.

While targeting 4-7% annual growth, Kapur notes near-term headwinds still constraining aerospace include supply chain disruptions, which aren't reflective across the entire economy. However, he envisions substantial growth long-term from \""electrification\"" in the aerospace industry. Kapur cits recent moves, like acquiring Carrier Global's (CARR) securities unit, are directly building on existing strengths, generating revenue and margin upside, calling it \""an extension\"" of Honeywell's current business model. In closing, Kapur emphasizes Honeywell's transformation into \""a growth-oriented company,\"" reallocating toward key secular trends including automation and sustainable tech.

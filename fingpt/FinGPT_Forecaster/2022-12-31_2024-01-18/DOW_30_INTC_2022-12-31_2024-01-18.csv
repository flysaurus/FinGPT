However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=097189c1983ad2a98e61f9934ae7f0e7c1307851661ded41cbd06f931dac6bd9""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1677776520, ""headline"": ""Intel Corp. stock outperforms market on strong trading day"", ""id"": 119071426, ""image"": ""https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social"", ""related"": ""INTC"", ""source"": ""MarketWatch"", ""summary"": ""Shares of Intel Corp. rallied 3.43% to $26.20 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around positive trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500..."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9a39b37780383a1fe1499a8295daefe9be792dc9aba30424e29b4039fca2ba10""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1677771480, ""headline"": ""Dow up nearly 400 points on gains in Salesforce, Intel shares"", ""id"": 119029191, ""image"": ""https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"", ""related"": ""INTC"", ""source"": ""MarketWatch"", ""summary"": ""Led by strong returns for shares of Salesforce and Intel, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is rallying Thursday afternoon.

The OpenAI platform introduced the world to generative AI, a type of AI that can be used in everyday functions. But what will 2024 bring? More AI. Bob O\u2019Donnell, TECHnalysis Research President & Chief Analyst joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the next wave of AI means for users, companies, and investors. Despite the craze over generative AI in the past year, O\u2019Donnell says that not many people in the workforce have been directly using the applications, but that\u2019s all going to change in the coming year. While everyday people are going to be using AI, businesses are going to see a greater impact than the average consumer, O\u2019Donnell maintains. Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest name associated with AI, but \""in 2024, we're going to see a ton of other semiconductor companies, obviously, be going after Nvidia. And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. In terms of semiconductors, O'Donnell points to announcements from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and how those companies will be looking to bring their chips to the masses. He also explains how tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are going to join the ring with Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM), pioneering the next generation of AI-processing software.For more episodes from our NEXT series, click here.

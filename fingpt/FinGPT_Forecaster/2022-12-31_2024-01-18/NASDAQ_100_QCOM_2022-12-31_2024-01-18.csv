Bob O\u2019Donnell, TECHnalysis Research President & Chief Analyst joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the next wave of AI means for users, companies, and investors. Despite the craze over generative AI in the past year, O\u2019Donnell says that not many people in the workforce have been directly using the applications, but that\u2019s all going to change in the coming year. While everyday people are going to be using AI, businesses are going to see a greater impact than the average consumer, O\u2019Donnell maintains. Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest name associated with AI, but \""in 2024, we're going to see a ton of other semiconductor companies, obviously, be going after Nvidia. And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. In terms of semiconductors, O'Donnell points to announcements from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and how those companies will be looking to bring their chips to the masses. He also explains how tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are going to join the ring with Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM), pioneering the next generation of AI-processing software.For more episodes from our NEXT series, click here.

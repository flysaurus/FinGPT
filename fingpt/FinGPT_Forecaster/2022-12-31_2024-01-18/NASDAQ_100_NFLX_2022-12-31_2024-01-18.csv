Patterson said, 'I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results.' While Leon added, 'this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth.' Full video transcript: Justin Patterson (00:00:06 -> 00:01:05) - Netflix is more of a pricing story. When you think about just the phasing of revenue growth this year and over the medium term, it's really a function of extracting more value from that customer base. Whether it's cracking down on the password sharing or moving from walk to run on the ad service where you have much more ads being delivered, better targeting, and ultimately better monetization of that time spent on the platform. How do you get just users to pay a little more, to consume more ads on a platform, so on and so forth? So I think you're in a transitional phase across the entire group. You are seeing some more volatility in just quarterly results. I don't think you'll actually start to see more normalized growth until 2024 when we get out of some of these macro factors near term. And a lot of these product initiatives, just move from initial testing phase toward broader deployment and adoption. Ken Leon (00:01:06 -> 00:01:57) - What does Netflix look like as it goes more significantly to paid sharing or friends and family? We're gonna see that in the second quarter. And the the other issue really relates to the ad pay plan. There hasn't been any cannibalization from the higher ad-free plan. And then advertising revenue really is not gonna be material until next year. And it all, for Netflix, it's kind of, it's not self-inflicted as, but this is really an adjustment for longer-term growth. I have total confidence that their $17 billion content spent on programming and film is the most efficient and highest return, and they got a global platform that enables them to have local programming by country and then share it in other parts of the world.

Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. \""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,\"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has \""emboldened\"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.\u00a0 The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the \""point of economic indifference,\"" Feldman says.

Even though consumers have been spending record amounts this holiday season, retailers have continued to struggle to draw them in, with Dollar Tree being no exception. Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets Managing Director, joins Yahoo Finance to give insights into Dollar Tree's quarterly performance and why he feels the company's go-forward outlook remains positive. Thomas explains: \""I think what may still be on the horizon is we see pressure on the job market, then you see more middle income consumers trade down into the dollar stores, and we haven't necessarily been seeing a lot of that yet. I think what well stood out in terms of weakness right now from a cyclical standpoint on the business was that discretionary category at the Family Dollar banner.\"" Thomas continues by saying: \""There may be some reason for optimism for patient investors to say that Dollar Tree and dollar stores in general could benefit from a cyclical recovery as you look at the longer term.\"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.""}, {""date"": ""2023-11-29"", ""headline"": ""Dollar Tree (DLTR) Slips on Q3 Earnings Miss, Narrowed View"", ""summary"": ""Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 results reflect gains across both segments, offset by adverse mix, higher shrink, product cost inflation, product recall, and wage investments in distribution center payroll.""}, {""date"": ""2023-11-29"", ""headline"": ""Dollar Tree reports sales growth in Q3 earnings miss"", ""summary"": ""Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares are trading in the green this morning despite falling short of third-quarter earnings estimates on the top and bottom lines.

At Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, NJ, Clouse tells Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi how he re-centered the historic brand, guided the company through the pandemic, and is now leading Campbell Soup into the future. Clouse leans on his leadership pillars: to set a clear vision, assemble a complementary team, and inspire and uplift employees. \u201cInstead of just being that constant force of execution and deliver, how do you create this feeling of empowerment?\u201d Clouse says. Clouse took over as the 14th CEO of Campbell Soup since the company was founded in 1869. One of his biggest moves since taking the reins, includes the acquisition of the popular pasta sauce brand, Rao\u2019s, along with their parent company, Sovos Brands (SOVO). Before taking the top job at Campbell Soup, Clouse served in leadership positions at Pinnacle Foods, now part of Conagra Brands (CAG), Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ), and The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC).

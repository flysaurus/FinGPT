Finance Live's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi, former Chrysler (STLA) and Home Depot (HD) CEO Bob Nardelli says the only thing certain about the challenges facing today's business community is how uncertain they are. During 2008, as then-CEO of Chrysler, Nardelli says he was \""singularly focused on the banking situation.\"" Today, banking chaos is no longer the only issue CEOs must navigate. Instead, the bedlam \""just adds another level of complexity\"" to a host of other hurdles. What challenges are those? Nardelli mentions supply chain woes and an excess demand for labor, along with the ever-present threat of inflation. That being said, the outlook for inflation has improved, based on data out this week. But a strong majority of economists still expect a 25bps interest rate hike from the Fed next week. \""The breadth of constituents that a CEO and a company has to try and satisfy,\"" Nardelli says, \""is as broad and as deep as I've ever seen it.\"" And therein lies the challenge. \""When you try to satisfy everyone, you end up satisfying no one.\"" Even more troublesome is how sudden these issues have sprouted. With the example of the SVB collapse, Nardelli points out, \""who went to bed Thursday night thinking that their deposits were going to be frozen on Friday?\"" Businesses today must deal with \""the certainty of uncertainty.\"" Looking closer at SVB, Nardelli says \""there seemed to be some potential inequity\"" with some investors that were \""aware to pull out $42 billion on Thursday,\"" while others \""couldn't make payroll because their accounts were frozen.\"" Key Video Moments: 00:00:34 -- What a CEO has to manage today is \""broad and deep\"" 00:01:02 -- When you try to satisfy everyone, you end up satisfying no one. 00:01:31 -- We're dealing with a \""certainty of uncertainty\"" 00:01:46 -- How did certain investors know to pull out their money from SVB?

Meanwhile earnings from Walmart (WMT) and TJX (TJX) were strong, whereas Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) sales took a hit. New York Times Retail Reporter Jordyn Holman joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what these recent earnings results are showing about the state of the consumer. Holman explains how consumers are being discerning at this time, which is something Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cPeople are buying groceries, they\u2019re trading down,\u201d which is \u201cpart of this longer trend that we\u2019ve been seeing over the past year,\u201d Holman says. Walmart has \u201ca bigger leg up\u201d than Target, Holman says because it sells more groceries and has lower price points. Target also experienced boycotts in June over pride-themed displays at stores, which impacted the company\u2019s sales. As this summer saw consumers spending on goods for experiences such as\u00a0Barbie\u00a0and tours from superstars Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, Holman notes that although \u201cpeople have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected...they\u2019re still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d \u201cIt still remains to be seen how long that can last,\u201d as people have a \u201cfinite amount of money,\u201d but that\u2019s \u201cone of these really interesting dynamics that\u2019s happened this summer,\u201d Holman says."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2f0c4c5d6ce851e5712a593b0300d32f7396e5cfe9f709898e45becb718b4487""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1692362640, ""headline"": ""What\u2019s going on in the bond market \u2014 and what will it mean for mortgage-loan rates?"", ""id"": 122218681, ""image"": ""https://images.mktw.net/im-838118/social"", ""related"": ""HD"", ""source"": ""MarketWatch"", ""summary"": ""Also: dividend stocks, China's economic problems, the rise of Uber and advice from the Tax Guy."", ""url"": ""https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9823645d41d118b6f47e3e030db0418372e37ee11c3a2915e30bd07d7ccc1c59""}, {""category"": ""company"", ""datetime"": 1692361800, ""headline"": ""Stocks Turn Lower As China Weakness, Rising Yields Pressure Markets"", ""id"": 122115615, ""image"": """", ""related"": ""HD"", ""source"": ""Benzinga"", ""summary"": ""Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

In May, Elon Musk named Linda Yaccarino the new CEO of Twitter. In July, Musk changed Twitter\u2019s name to X. 9.

Taylor Swift and the Taylor-made economy (00:00:56) It was a big year for Taylor Swift as she embarked on her Eras Tour and released Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert film. Swift also received several mentions in financial news for her impact on the economy and consumer spending. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer breaks down some of Swift\u2019s recognitions in the world of finance news. On July 12, Swift received a mention in the Fed Beige Book as the Philadelphia Fed noted the boost in hotel sales and the economy when her Eras Tour came to town.

Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year. We won\u2019t know retail theft\u2019s impact for 2023 till next year, but Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brooke DiPalma takes a look at the average shrink rate in 2022. According to the National Retail Federation, there was $112.1 billion of losses in fiscal year 2022, which was up 1.6 percent year-over-year. Organized retail theft made up 36 percent of that number, while internal theft made up 29 percent. Process errors made up 27 percent and unknown reasons made up the last seven percent. 5. Weight Loss Drug Craze (00:01:56) Weight loss drugs have grown in popularity this year. Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the GLP-1 drugs. \u201cThere\u2019s type 2 diabetes drugs and weight loss drugs that make up the class of GLP-1 drugs\u2026 The diabetes drugs are Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Mounjaro, which are both available off-label for weight loss,\u201d Khemlani notes. Yahoo Finance named Novo Nordisk as the 2023 Company of the Year, as the company's Ozempic and Wegovy are very popular drugs in the weight loss space. 4. Union Strikes (00:02:15) The entertainment and automotive industry were both impacted by strikes this year as Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and United Auto Workers went on strike. The WGA went on strike in May and the SAG joined the writers on the picket line in July. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal notes that although the WGA and SAG are different, \u201cthe threadline is similar, in terms of what they were fighting for.\u201d Some elements in the actors' deal included, 7% general wage hike, AI protections, and $40 million a year streaming residual bonus. The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3. Collapse of Regional Banks (00:02:33) Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were two of the regional banks that collapsed this year. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the timeline of the collapses. On March 8, SVB planned an emergency stock sale and on March 9, customers attempted to withdraw $42 billion. On March 10, regulators shut down SVB and two days later, on March 12, regulators shutdown Signature Bank. 2. The Fed (00:03:06) Inflation and interest rates continued to impact Americans this year. \u201cThe Central Bank began 2023 slowing the pace of its most aggressive rate hiking campaign to cool inflation since the 1980s,\u201d Yahoo Finance Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains. \u201cAs 2023 comes to an end, that campaigns appears to be all but over.\u201d 1. AI (00:03:24) It has been quite the year for artificial intelligence. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley takes a look at the year AI has had. \u201cTo say that 2023 was the year of AI, would be the understatement of, well, the year,\u201d Howley says. In second quarter 2023, AI was mentioned 62 times at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), 58 times at Microsoft (MSFT), and 827 times in total for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to Reuters. Although 2023 was the year of AI, \u201cit started in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI,\u201d Howley notes. \u201cThe chat bot quickly became the fastest growing app in history, to that point,\u201d hitting 100 million users in two months. In May 2023, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) market value \u201cbriefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time. Cementing its status as the AI chip leader,\u201d Howley explains.

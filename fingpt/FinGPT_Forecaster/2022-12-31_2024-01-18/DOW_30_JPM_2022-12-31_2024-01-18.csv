Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, joined Yahoo Finance to share what he thinks you should do if you have over $250,000 in your bank account. Polcari\u2019s first piece of advice is to diversify your banking relationships, saying having at least two is best, \u201cone big money-centered bank, Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC) or Wells Fargo (WFC) or Citibank (C) And then if you want to put money in a local or a regional bank that's in your area\u2026 you could certainly do that.\u201d Polcari\u2019s second tip for large account holders is to try investing in treasuries, \u201cbuy treasuries short term, three months, six months.

The firm, alongside several other venture capitalists, originally came out in support of SVB almost two weeks ago, issuing a joint statement encouraging companies to stay with the bank \""in the event that SVB were to be purchased and appropriately capitalized.\"" Even though almost half of all VC-backed companies banked with SVB, Kaul says the startup ecosystem remains \""as vibrant as ever.\"" That being said, he added the effects from the bank's early March collapse could take another 3 to 6 months to fully shakeout. The lesson to be learned from SVB's collapse: diversity. Smaller, more regional banks that specialize in certain industries are crucial for the economy. The hope, Kaul says, is that banks catering specifically to startups and entrepreneurs will still be around in the wake of SVB. Smaller, more specialized banks are important because they truly understand the unique needs of their customers. The California wine industry had a knowledgeable partner with SVB, and there's now uncertainty among some winemakers on how to move forward.

Finance Live. \""The Fed made a terrible mistake to keep interest rates so low for so long,\"" says Gillian Tett, U.S. editor-at-large at the Financial Times. She says the financial system is geared to preferring lower rates, and that the Fed's continued hawkishness shows the central bank is trying to \""overreact and jam on the brakes to atone for the big mistake it made earlier.\"" A period of low interest rates made it easier for banks to take bigger risks, but ultimately led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank as interest rates resumed their climb under central bank hawkishness. The collapse created instability in smaller regional banks, and even in larger banks like Credit Suisse (CS) with exposures to the sector. Several banks have undergone rescues, with Credit Suisse recently being bought out by rival UBS (UBS) in a deal orchestrated by Swiss finance officials worth $3.2 billion. Experts say the rescue plans give banks too much security. \""They're aware of the risk, but they're expecting the bailout,\"" says Dylan Ratigan, Host of \u201cTruth or Skepticism\u201d on Tastytrade. \""These are people that benefitted from the credit expansion in 2006, then there was a massive overcompensation, which is the zero rates,\"" he says. But while the solution is not yet obvious, Tett says rescue methods like guaranteeing deposits encourage and amplify risk-taking behavior among banks. \""The only thing that's worse than moral hazard, which the system is riddled with right now, is unpredictable moral hazard,\"" she says. Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Julie Hyman spoke to Tett, Ratigan and others.

He says he was \""stunned\"" by Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr's testimony statement, which says \""it is not the job of supervisors to fix the issues identified; it is the job of the bank's senior management and board of directors to fix its problems.\"" The problems present in the banking sector should be addressed, Nocera says, by bringing back the \""sensible regulations\"" originally imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar. \""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided\"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.

In a conversation with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi, the executive shared his thoughts on March\u2019s banking sector meltdown.

Still, it\u2019s possible authorities could\u2019ve \u201cmore closely monitoring Silicon Valley Bank.\u201d The Federal Reserve, Rubenstein says, has the ability to go in to smaller banks like SVB and require them to put in more capital, noting that the board in San Francisco \""probably should've been more on top of it.\"" When asked how the CEOs of these institutions let things spiral out of control, Rubenstein says \u201chindsight is always 20/20.\u201d Specifically looking at the rapid growth of Silicon Valley Bank, he notes that leadership found a specific business model that \u201cseemed\u201d to work: lend money to VC, require 85% cash be held in the bank, then invest those deposits in treasury bills. Certainly that was a problem that could've been\""picked up on\"" earlier, but it seems to be contained. Rubenstein's comments echoed sentiment shared by the IMF earlier this week, who also noted central banks appear more stable. He also offered his outlook on the potential purchase of First Republic Bank (FRC), saying he suspects the government will \u201cprovide some assistance\u201d to address the \u201cbig hole in the balance sheet,\u201d if anyone is going to buy the regional institution. The banking issues boiled down to the simple truth that some smaller institutions were \""growing a little too rapidly.\"" Bigger banks, meanwhile, are in \u201cpretty good shape\u201d and well capitalized. Rubenstein adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the problem we had in \u201807, \u201808.\u201d He did, however, caution that European banks may not be as strong as their U.S. counterparts, specifically mentioning Credit Suisse\u2019s (CS) recent failure.

'I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable,' said Laidler.  While Heltman stated that 'this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later.'  Full video transcript:  John Heltman (00:00:05) - The banks that have reported so far, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, did better than expected, but these are some of the bigger banks. The place to watch is the mid-size regionals, the PNCs, the M&Ts. PNC's numbers came in last week and they were, you know, decent. Although their warning of concerns about tighter net interest margins with cost of funds really going up and cost of long-dated loans staying the same. So that's something to watch, especially for smaller and mid-size banks. You saw the last month $300 billion in deposits left banks and something like $240 billion went into money market funds. And that's for the simple reason that they make more money in a money market fund than in a bank, although they don't have the security of deposit insurance that you have with a bank. So this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later, to figure out how to even the playing field between money market funds and banks and bank deposits, to figure out how to stem that tide. But it's not, I don't predict it being a giant rush, but it's gonna be a slow drip over time and a slow drip that is going to impact, especially, as I said, the smaller and medium-sized banks. Ben Laidler (00:01:16) - Financial conditions are tightening. I think the banks are gonna be doing the Fed's work for it. We're not saying there's a banking crisis, but, you know, we have lived through a scare. And I think that means a couple of things. I think deposits are leaving the system. They're being attracted into money market funds by the 5% rates that are on offer versus the sub 1% you get at your bank. That predates SVB and the recent banking scare. So I think that's gonna continue and you've absolutely seen that even with the results from the big banks.\u00a0 Secondly, I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable. And I think thirdly, the smaller banks have seen, you know, the worst of this sort of deposit outflows are gonna see the worst of this regulatory crackdown. But I think regardless everybody is gonna be lending less going forward than they might otherwise have done. And lending standards already tightening.

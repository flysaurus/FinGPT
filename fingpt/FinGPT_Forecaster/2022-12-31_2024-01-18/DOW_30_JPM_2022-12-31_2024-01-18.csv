Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, joined Yahoo Finance to share what he thinks you should do if you have over $250,000 in your bank account.

The firm, alongside several other venture capitalists, originally came out in support of SVB almost two weeks ago, issuing a joint statement encouraging companies to stay with the bank \""in the event that SVB were to be purchased and appropriately capitalized.\"" Even though almost half of all VC-backed companies banked with SVB, Kaul says the startup ecosystem remains \""as vibrant as ever.\"" That being said, he added the effects from the bank's early March collapse could take another 3 to 6 months to fully shakeout. The lesson to be learned from SVB's collapse: diversity. Smaller, more regional banks that specialize in certain industries are crucial for the economy. The hope, Kaul says, is that banks catering specifically to startups and entrepreneurs will still be around in the wake of SVB. Smaller, more specialized banks are important because they truly understand the unique needs of their customers. The California wine industry had a knowledgeable partner with SVB, and there's now uncertainty among some winemakers on how to move forward.

She says the financial system is geared to preferring lower rates, and that the Fed's continued hawkishness shows the central bank is trying to \""overreact and jam on the brakes to atone for the big mistake it made earlier.\"" A period of low interest rates made it easier for banks to take bigger risks, but ultimately led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank as interest rates resumed their climb under central bank hawkishness. The collapse created instability in smaller regional banks, and even in larger banks like Credit Suisse (CS) with exposures to the sector. Several banks have undergone rescues, with Credit Suisse recently being bought out by rival UBS (UBS) in a deal orchestrated by Swiss finance officials worth $3.2 billion. Experts say the rescue plans give banks too much security. \""They're aware of the risk, but they're expecting the bailout,\"" says Dylan Ratigan, Host of \u201cTruth or Skepticism\u201d on Tastytrade. \""These are people that benefitted from the credit expansion in 2006, then there was a massive overcompensation, which is the zero rates,\"" he says. But while the solution is not yet obvious, Tett says rescue methods like guaranteeing deposits encourage and amplify risk-taking behavior among banks. \""The only thing that's worse than moral hazard, which the system is riddled with right now, is unpredictable moral hazard,\"" she says.

Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar. \""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided\"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.

In a conversation with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi, the executive shared his thoughts on March\u2019s banking sector meltdown. Rubenstein says that overall, the U.S. Government did a \u201creasonably good job\u201d with their response. Still, it\u2019s possible authorities could\u2019ve \u201cmore closely monitoring Silicon Valley Bank.\u201d The Federal Reserve, Rubenstein says, has the ability to go in to smaller banks like SVB and require them to put in more capital, noting that the board in San Francisco \""probably should've been more on top of it.\"" When asked how the CEOs of these institutions let things spiral out of control, Rubenstein says \u201chindsight is always 20/20.\u201d Specifically looking at the rapid growth of Silicon Valley Bank, he notes that leadership found a specific business model that \u201cseemed\u201d to work: lend money to VC, require 85% cash be held in the bank, then invest those deposits in treasury bills. Certainly that was a problem that could've been\""picked up on\"" earlier, but it seems to be contained. Rubenstein's comments echoed sentiment shared by the IMF earlier this week, who also noted central banks appear more stable. He also offered his outlook on the potential purchase of First Republic Bank (FRC), saying he suspects the government will \u201cprovide some assistance\u201d to address the \u201cbig hole in the balance sheet,\u201d if anyone is going to buy the regional institution. The banking issues boiled down to the simple truth that some smaller institutions were \""growing a little too rapidly.\"" Bigger banks, meanwhile, are in \u201cpretty good shape\u201d and well capitalized. Rubenstein adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the problem we had in \u201807, \u201808.\u201d He did, however, caution that European banks may not be as strong as their U.S. counterparts, specifically mentioning Credit Suisse\u2019s (CS) recent failure.

'I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable,' said Laidler.  While Heltman stated that 'this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later.'  Full video transcript:  John Heltman (00:00:05) - The banks that have reported so far, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, did better than expected, but these are some of the bigger banks. The place to watch is the mid-size regionals, the PNCs, the M&Ts. PNC's numbers came in last week and they were, you know, decent. Although their warning of concerns about tighter net interest margins with cost of funds really going up and cost of long-dated loans staying the same. So that's something to watch, especially for smaller and mid-size banks. You saw the last month $300 billion in deposits left banks and something like $240 billion went into money market funds. And that's for the simple reason that they make more money in a money market fund than in a bank, although they don't have the security of deposit insurance that you have with a bank. So this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later, to figure out how to even the playing field between money market funds and banks and bank deposits, to figure out how to stem that tide. But it's not, I don't predict it being a giant rush, but it's gonna be a slow drip over time and a slow drip that is going to impact, especially, as I said, the smaller and medium-sized banks. Ben Laidler (00:01:16) - Financial conditions are tightening. I think the banks are gonna be doing the Fed's work for it. We're not saying there's a banking crisis, but, you know, we have lived through a scare. And I think that means a couple of things. I think deposits are leaving the system. They're being attracted into money market funds by the 5% rates that are on offer versus the sub 1% you get at your bank. That predates SVB and the recent banking scare. So I think that's gonna continue and you've absolutely seen that even with the results from the big banks.\u00a0 Secondly, I think there's gonna be a regulatory crackdown. I think that's absolutely inevitable. And I think thirdly, the smaller banks have seen, you know, the worst of this sort of deposit outflows are gonna see the worst of this regulatory crackdown. But I think regardless everybody is gonna be lending less going forward than they might otherwise have done. And lending standards already tightening. So again, I think this is just, you know, we've already got the lagged effect of 5% interest rates, and now on top of that, we've got banks which are gonna be lending less, and that that combination is gonna slow the economy in slow earnings, which we really haven't seen yet.

The decision comes against the backdrop of a regional banking crisis, the most recent casualty of which was First Republic Bank, which failed Sunday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rescued the bank's assets, but the volatility sent regional bank stocks tumbling on Tuesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was confronted with questions not only about the banking crisis, but about the looming debt ceiling standoff. The Treasury Department warned this week that without action, the U.S. could run out of money to pay its debts by June 1st. \u201cNo one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short and long term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time,\u201d Powell said. Dennis Lockhart, Former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, joined Yahoo Finance\u2019s Seana Smith and Diane King Hall to discuss Powell\u2019s remarks. Lockhart said, \u201cit looks like Congress, particularly the Republican caucus in the House, is playing chicken with the administration on this.\u201d Lockhart said he has observed these kinds of standoffs before, \u201c...but this one does strike me as a little bit different, a little bit more dangerous because the game of chicken, if you will or, the standoff, just seems to be a little bit more firm and more dug in.

Earnings reports from companies including Walgreens and Constellation Brands, and key economic data such as the JOLTS and December jobs report, are all set to come out this week. Yahoo Finance breaks down what to watch in the first week of the year. On the earnings side, several companies will be reporting results. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) will be reporting on Wednesday, January 3, while Conagra Brands (CAG) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will report before the open on Thursday, January 4. Constellation Brands (STZ) will close out the week, reporting results on Friday, January 5. On the economic data front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report for November will be released on Wednesday, January 3, with \u201cjobs openings expected to rise roughly 8.8 million from the 8.7 million in October,\u201d as Yahoo Finance\u2019s Madison Mills discusses. Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting will be released on Wednesday, January 3 and \u201cwe perhaps will get more clarity on the Fed\u2019s thinking around rate cuts\u201d from the minutes, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jennifer Schonberger says. ADP employment will come out on Thursday, January 4 and the December jobs report will be released on Friday, January 5. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer breaks down expectations for the December jobs report. \u201cEconomists are telling me that the biggest story in 2024 is going to be the labor market,\u201d Schafer notes. 168,000 jobs are expected to be added in December, which is down from 199,000 in November and the unemployment rate is expected to come in at 3.8 percent, which would be slightly up from 3.7 percent in November, according to Bloomberg. \u201cThis picture here fits the narrative we\u2019ve been talking about of a cooling labor market, but not one that\u2019s ice cold, not one that\u2019s going into recession.\u201d Schafer adds, \u201coverall on Friday, we\u2019re looking for more signs of cooling and making sure things aren\u2019t getting too cold.\u201d Key video moments: 00:00:17 - What to watch this week 00:00:43 - FOMC December minutes 00:00:51 - December jobs report expectations""}, {""date"": ""20240102223600"", ""headline"": ""New Year, New Gains: The 3 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2024"", ""summary"": ""Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

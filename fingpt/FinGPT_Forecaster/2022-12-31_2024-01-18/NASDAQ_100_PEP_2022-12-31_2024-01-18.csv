They declined more than 9% compared to S&P's 12% gain so far. A surge in treasury yields, signs of a weakening consumer and the strong dollar all weighed on the sector. But is now the time to scoop in and buy some of those beaten down names? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to get their top stock picks. UBS U.S. Household and Personal Care Analyst Peter Grom provided his thoughts on the consumer staples sector overall. Grom said, \""You have this perfect storm of events that's driving the weaker performance of consumer staples ... last year, even though rates were rising, I think the market was more positioned with the defensive tilt, and I think we're kind of seeing some normalization of that.\"" PepsiCo (PEP) reported third quarter results that topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston explained the company's approach with regard to the consumer.

So, we put ourselves in a good position to meet or beat our guidance.\u201d Procter & Gamble (PG) reported first quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.

Our global aggregate share was up 40 basis points.\u201d Portfolio Wealth Advisors President & CIO Lee Munson provided his thoughts on consumer staples including Hershey (HSY). Munson said, \""Hershey is down double digits from its high this year. There used to be a time when a stock had a 2.5% dividend that was actually higher than a ten-year treasury and people loved it.

It\u2019s a market dominated by just three products so far \u2013 Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, Wegovy, and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Mounjaro. These drugs belong to a class known as GLP-1s, named after a hormone in the body they mimic which slows down digestion. Analysts say this could impact a number of industries and change long-term consumer habits. Here are the top things investors need to know. 1. Preliminary forecasts (00:00:31) Everything from food and beverage to medical devices, insulin, and bariatric surgery \u2013 are all estimated to see slower revenues due to GLP-1 use. The drugs could eventually impact industries like snack and beverages, restaurants, tobacco, gaming, apparel, food, and retail, according to Bank of America (BAC) analysts. 2. Consumer staples (00:00:52) While prescriptions are regulated, it hasn\u2019t stopped people from getting access \u2013 especially if they are willing to shell out the annual $15,000 out of pocket. Combined with other headwinds, the S&P Consumer Staples Index is down 3% year-to-date, compared to the 8% gain the larger index enjoyed. 3. Food and beverage (00:01:10) Companies like Hershey (HSY), PepsiCo (PEP), and Coca-Cola (KO) have already been diversifying their portfolios to cater to shifting consumer needs, introducing zero calorie options and smaller sizes. Restaurants sales could be hit too, though if diners opt for pricier salads over burgers, overall sales could end up getting a boost. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma says that the impact could be felt by certain restaurant chains.\""Jack in the Box and Taco Bell, all owned by Yum! Brands (YUM), are often visited by snackers in the early afternoon or late night after 9 pm,\"" says DiPalma. \""Coffee giants like Starbucks (SBUX) and Dutch Bros (BROS) typically cater to visits that are not necessarily tied to consuming a meal.\"" 4. Medical devices and pharmaceuticals (00:01:54) The popularity of the drugs has put pressure on bariatric surgery, which has seen a slight slowdown since the start of the year. Medical devices like insulin pumps and glucose monitoring devices have not been impacted by the drugs, despite analyst predictions. 5. Current market (00:02:08) Despite being used by a little over 1% of the U.S. population, the drugs have seen record demand this year. Analysts say sales of Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro, which is still only approved to treat diabetes, are already on a $4 billion run rate. And the popularity of Ozempic briefly made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe last month. Currently, Mounjaro has 23% of the overall weight loss market, while Ozempic occupies a 42% share. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani says that the drugs have been \""really spectacular at providing record weight loss.\"" Khemlani added, \""Ozempic really taking the lead there with $3.1 billion alone for the last quarter. Meanwhile, Wegovy over $1 billion, and Mounjaro just getting to that $1 billion mark, making them already blockbuster drugs.\"" 6. What's next? (00:02:56) So what does this all mean? Well, the reality is the long-term implications of these weight loss drugs are largely unknown. They may not permanently change consumer behavior, or they may only be hastening trends that were already underway.""}, {""date"": ""20231030233200"", ""headline"": ""Microsoft: Leveraging AI and the Cloud"", ""summary"": ""Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

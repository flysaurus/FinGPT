Although BMO Capital Markets Managing Director Simeon Siegel agrees about being watchful over retail reports, he feels \u201coptimistic\u201d that the holiday shopping season is off to a good start. The biggest question Siegel raises is how the retailers are going to perform during the lull between Cyber Week and Christmas. When it comes to the winners in retail, Siegel says those who \u201cpredict their demand well are going to continue to win, and those that don\u2019t are going to continue to lose.\u201d Storch projects that Walmart (WMT), TJX Companies (TJX), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST) will have a successful holiday shopping season. Siegel\u2019s retail winners also include TJX Companies, as well as Ross Stores (ROST), Burlington (BURL), and Coach (owned by Tapestry (TPR)).For more from Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way series: Click here for more videos and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.

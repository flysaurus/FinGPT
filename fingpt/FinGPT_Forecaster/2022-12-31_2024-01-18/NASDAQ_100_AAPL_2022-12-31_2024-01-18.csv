It\u2019s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that\u2019s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, \u2018you just have to be there.\u2019 It\u2019s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who\u2019s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they\u2019re all going for the same reason- they\u2019re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You\u2019ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I\u2019m talking about AI and what some are calling \u201cdeep tech\u201d \u2013 those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics.

We\u2019ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we\u2019re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW\u00a0is the main stage. Over the past few years, there\u2019s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)\u2014 why are the world\u2019s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food? Or maybe it\u2019s the vibe?

Select the options menu, by pressing the hamburger button in the top right of the screen, and tap Settings and Privacy in the pop-up window. Next press Account, then select Deactivate or Delete Account, and pick Delete account permanently.

Overall, it looks as though this is going to help improve the Mac revenue. We just have to see how much of an impact it has.\"" Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin also discussed Apple's new product line and some of the challenges that Apple is facing ahead of earnings.

Here's a look back at his expert insight and advice as we commemorate his monumental legacy. Charlie Munger on Berkshire Hathaway deals (00:00:25) \""I can't think of a single example in my whole life where keep keeping it simple has worked against us,\"" Munger said. \""We made mistakes but they weren't because we kept it simple.\"" Charlie Munger on investment advice to younger generations (00:00:55) \""To flit around to various careers and go into the other fellow's professional territory and try and outdo him and do all kinds of things like that, I think will not work for most people,\"" Munger explained. \""A young man goes to see Mozart and says, Mozart, I want to start composing symphonies. And Mozart said, how old are you? And the guy says, 22. And he says, you're too young to do symphonies. And the guy says, yes, but you were 10 years old when you were composing semis.

But how were they able to achieve such success? Behind The Ticker charts its path from humble beginnings to its transformation into a tech giant. 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in Los Altos, California. The company's first product, the Apple I, was invented by Wozniak and sold later that year. 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh, announced by a $1.5 million television commercial during Super Bowl XVIII. It was the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphic user interface and mouse. 1985 Steve Jobs left Apple and founded the NeXT computer company. 1991 Apple introduced the Power Macintosh line, utilizing PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM. It is a design that set the standard for most modern laptops. 1996 Steve Jobs returned after leaving the company over a decade earlier. Apple purchased Jobs' NeXT company for its operating system. Jobs was named interim CEO in 1997 and became CEO again in 2000. 1998 The iMac was introduced, selling almost 800,000 units in its first five months. 2001 Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores to be located throughout major U.S. markets. The first iPod, storing around 1,000 songs, was introduced later that year. 2007 Apple debuted the iPhone, a revolutionary product that changed the way smartphones look and function. 2011 Steve Jobs suffered from pancreatic cancer. He resigned from his position as CEO just before his death and Tim Cook took over as CEO. 2015 The Apple Watch was launched, the first new product range since the departure of Jobs. 2022 Apple became the world's first publicly traded $3 trillion company. It is currently the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. 2023 Apple unveiled the Vision Pro which is a mixed-reality headset. Its 2024 launch will mark the first product debut in a new major category since the Apple Watch. Apple will launch the Vision Pro on February 2, 2024, in the U.S., with pre-orders starting on January 19.

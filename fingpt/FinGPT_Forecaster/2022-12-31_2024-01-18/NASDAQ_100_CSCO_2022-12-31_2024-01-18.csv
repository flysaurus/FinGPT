And more importantly, what do investors need to know? We go behind the ticker: Zscaler (ZS) is a fast growing competitor in the cyber security and enterprise space, with a market cap of about $17 billion. According to its website, \u201cZscaler anticipates, secures, and simplifies the experience of doing business for the world's most established companies.\u201d So what is it? Who\u2019s using Zscaler\u2019s software and services? Well, the company protects consumer data for Charles Schwab (SCHW), it created work-from-home platforms for government entities like the City of Los Angeles, and built e-commerce infrastructure for giant consumer goods manufacturer, Unilever (UL). As Zscaler CEO, Jay Chaudhry explained to Yahoo Finance, \""The world has to move to adapt new technologies, like Zero Trust. That's the real answer. Many companies are making progress, and many are behind.\"" Headquartered in San Jose, California, Zscaler operates in 185 countries around the world, with a workforce of more than 2500 employees. It trades under the ticker symbol (ZS), with shares up 270% since its first day of trading in 2018.\u00a0 Zscaler\u2019s flagship product is the \u2018Zero Trust Exchange,' a cloud platform that\u2019s distributed across more than 150 data centers around the world. \""The way Zscaler was designed, it was assumed that the user could be working from anywhere and applications could be in data center, in factory. It's all in the cloud, so it doesn't matter because in the Zero Trust architecture, we don't put users on the network. We connect them like a switchboard,\"" says Chaudhry. Like many pandemic darlings, like Cisco (CSCO), Okta (OKTA) and Cloudlfare (NET), the shares peaked in 2021 and have fallen more than 40% over the last year. Despite a poor performance in the stock market, Zscaler\u2019s revenue has grown steadily since the pandemic due to the rise of hybrid work and a widespread transition to the cloud.""}]",{}

Whenever we have new technologies, they\u2019re used to achieve positive goals and\u2026 for some challenging things as well,\u201d Gates notes. \u201cWhen we computers, books, video games... we had to think\u2026 what\u2019s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those\u2026 negative things.\u201d Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that \u201cAI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you\u2019ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.\u201d Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta\u2019s AI products have benefited advertisers. \u201cBack in \u201922, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite.
